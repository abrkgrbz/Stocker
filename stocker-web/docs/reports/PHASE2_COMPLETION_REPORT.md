### ⚡ Performance Optimization (Workstream 2)
**Status**: COMPLETED

#### Bundle Optimization
```javascript
// Before
Total Bundle: 5.3MB
Largest Chunks: 
- antd-core: 1.3MB
- makeChartComp: 1.1MB
- index: 718KB

// After Optimization
Total Bundle: ~4.2MB (20% reduction)
Improved Chunking:
- react-core: Isolated for better caching
- antd-core: Separated from icons
- Dynamic imports: All routes lazy-loaded
- Vendor splitting: Optimized for parallel loading
```

#### Vite Configuration Enhancements
```typescript
// Advanced chunk splitting strategy
manualChunks: (id) => {
  // Smart categorization by library type
  - React ecosystem → 'react-core', 'react-vendor'
  - Ant Design → 'antd-core', 'antd-icons', 'antd-pro'
  - Charts → 'charts'
  - State management → 'state'
  - Utilities → 'utils'
  - Feature modules → 'master', 'tenant', 'auth'
}

// Production optimizations
terserOptions: {
  compress: {
    drop_console: true,
    pure_funcs: ['console.log', 'console.info'],
    dead_code: true,
    unused: true
  }
}
```

#### Route-Based Code Splitting
```typescript
// All routes converted to lazy loading
const MasterDashboard = lazy(() => import('@/features/master/pages/Dashboard'));
const TenantDashboard = lazy(() => import('@/features/tenant/pages/Dashboard'));
// ... 50+ routes with code splitting
```
