# Integration Tests Final Status - September 2025

## Issues Identified
1. **SQLite Incompatibility**: Entity configurations use SQL Server specific syntax (e.g., 'max' keyword)
2. **EnsureCreated Fails**: Cannot create tables due to SQL syntax errors
3. **Complex Entity Model**: Too many navigation properties and configurations for simple testing

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Changed from in-memory to file-based SQLite
2. ✅ Used EnsureDeleted + EnsureCreated approach
3. ✅ Added proper connection management
4. ❌ Could not resolve SQL syntax incompatibility

## Root Cause
The entity configurations in the project are tightly coupled to SQL Server and not compatible with SQLite. This makes integration testing with SQLite impossible without major refactoring.

## Recommendations
1. **Option A**: Use SQL Server LocalDB for integration tests
2. **Option B**: Create separate entity configurations for SQLite
3. **Option C**: Mock repositories instead of using real database
4. **Option D**: Use TestContainers with SQL Server Docker image

## Current Test Status
- **Unit Tests**: 2196/2210 passing (99.37%) ✅
- **Integration Tests**: 0/15 passing (blocked by DB issues) ❌
- **Overall Coverage**: ~35-40%

## Next Steps if Continuing
1. Install SQL Server LocalDB
2. Update SimplifiedIntegrationTestBase to use LocalDB
3. Apply migrations properly
4. Run integration tests with real SQL Server
