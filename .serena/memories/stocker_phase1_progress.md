# Stocker Frontend - Phase 1 Progress Report

## âœ… Phase 0: Emergency Stabilization - COMPLETED
- yarn.lock removed, npm standardized
- Production console dropping enabled  
- Test infrastructure operational (Vitest)
- ErrorBoundary with Sentry integration
- Accessibility scanner configured
- Bundle size reduced (MUI removed, ~800KB saved)

## ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Performance Optimization - IN PROGRESS

### Workstream 1: Quality & Testing Foundation - Week 1 COMPLETED
âœ… Test infrastructure with Vitest
âœ… Critical path tests (auth, tenant, dashboard)
âœ… Test helpers and utilities
âœ… CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
âœ… Coverage structure configured (target: 60%)

### Workstream 2: Performance Optimization - Week 1 IN PROGRESS

#### Completed Tasks âœ…
1. **Bundle Analysis**: Identified large dependencies
2. **MUI Removal**: Removed Material-UI dependencies (~800KB saved)
3. **Code Splitting Configuration**: 
   - Improved manualChunks function
   - Separate vendor bundles for better caching
   - Charts, utils, state management separated

#### Bundle Optimization Results
- Before: ~5.3MB total bundle
- After MUI removal: ~4.5MB 
- With code splitting: Better caching and parallel loading

#### Remaining Performance Tasks
- [ ] Lazy loading for heavy components
- [ ] Route-based code splitting improvements
- [ ] Chart library consolidation
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup
- [ ] Web Vitals tracking

## Current Metrics
- Build: âœ… Successful
- Bundle size: Reduced by ~15%
- Code splitting: âœ… Configured
- Test coverage: ~20% (needs improvement)

## Next Steps
1. Complete route-based lazy loading
2. Consolidate chart libraries (remove duplicates)
3. Implement performance monitoring
4. Increase test coverage to 60%
5. Add E2E tests with Playwright
