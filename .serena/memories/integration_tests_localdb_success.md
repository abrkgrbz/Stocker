# Integration Tests with LocalDB - Success!

## ✅ Achievements
1. **LocalDB Configuration**: Successfully configured SQL Server LocalDB for integration tests
2. **Database Creation**: Test databases are being created successfully
3. **New LocalDB Instance**: Created "TestDB" instance to avoid permission issues
4. **Connection Established**: Tests can connect to LocalDB and create schema

## Configuration Used
```csharp
var connectionString = $"Server=(localdb)\\TestDB;Database={_databaseName};Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;TrustServerCertificate=true";
```

## Current Status
- Database: ✅ Working
- Schema Creation: ✅ Working
- API Endpoint: ❌ 404 error (routing issue)

## Next Steps
1. Fix API routing in WebApplicationFactory
2. Ensure controllers are registered in test environment
3. Complete authentication tests
4. Run full integration test suite

## Test Progress
- Unit Tests: 2196/2210 passing (99.37%)
- Integration Tests: 0/15 passing (API routing issue)
- Database Tests: Working with LocalDB

## Lessons Learned
- SQLite is not compatible with SQL Server specific entity configurations
- LocalDB is the best solution for integration tests
- Need to create separate LocalDB instance to avoid permission issues
