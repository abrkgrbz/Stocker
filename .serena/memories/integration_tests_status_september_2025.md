# Integration Tests Status - 23 September 2025

## Current Status
- **Total Integration Tests**: 15
- **Passing**: 0
- **Failing**: 15 (100%)

## Issues Found
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: SQLite in-memory database schema doesn't match entity models
2. **EnsureCreated Problems**: Not creating all required tables for Master database
3. **Authentication Tests**: All failing due to database issues
4. **Tenant Tests**: All failing due to database issues

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Added missing columns to MasterUsers table (EmailVerifiedAt, tokens, etc.)
2. ✅ Switched from manual SQL to EnsureCreated for schema generation
3. ✅ Updated SimplifiedIntegrationTestBase configuration

## Root Cause
- Integration tests need proper database migrations for SQLite
- Entity configurations may not be compatible with SQLite
- Need to ensure all navigation properties and relationships are properly configured

## Next Steps Required
1. Review entity configurations for SQLite compatibility
2. Create proper test data builders that handle all required fields
3. Consider using real SQLite file instead of in-memory for better debugging
4. Fix authentication endpoint routing issues (404 errors on /api/auth/register)
