# Audit Logging Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### 1. **Domain Layer** - Core Entities
- ✅ Created `SecurityAuditLog.cs` entity with:
  - Factory methods for auth and security events
  - Risk score calculation
  - Fluent API for building audit entries
  - GDPR compliance with retention policies

### 2. **Infrastructure Layer** - Persistence
- ✅ Created `SecurityAuditLogConfiguration.cs` - EF Core configuration
  - MSSQL-optimized indexes for performance
  - Composite indexes for common queries
  - Filtered index for high-risk events (>50)
- ✅ Updated `MasterDbContext.cs` - Added DbSet<SecurityAuditLog>
- ✅ Created `SecurityAuditService.cs` - Service implementation with:
  - Auth event logging
  - Security event logging
  - Failed login attempt tracking
  - Unusual login pattern detection (IP/UserAgent)
- ✅ Updated `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` - DI registration

### 3. **Application Layer** - CQRS Commands
- ✅ Created `ISecurityAuditService.cs` interface
- ✅ Updated `LoginCommand.cs` - Added IpAddress and UserAgent properties
- ✅ Updated `LoginCommandHandler.cs` - Comprehensive audit logging:
  - Unusual pattern detection before authentication
  - Success/failure event logging
  - Master admin login tracking
  - Progressive risk scoring based on failed attempts
  - Metadata capture with error details
  - Performance timing with Stopwatch

### 4. **API Layer** - Controllers
- ✅ Updated `PublicController.cs` - CheckEmail endpoint with audit logging (4 scenarios)
- ✅ Updated `AuthController.cs` - Login endpoint extracts IP/UserAgent
- ✅ Updated `MasterAuthController.cs` - Master admin login extracts IP/UserAgent
- ✅ Updated `SecureAuthController.cs` - Secure login extracts IP/UserAgent

### 5. **Database Migration**
- ✅ Created migration: `20251008003701_AddSecurityAuditLog.cs`
- ⏳ Migration needs to be applied to database

## 📊 Audit Events Tracked

### Authentication Events (GdprCategory: "authentication")
- `email_check_success` - User email found with tenant
- `email_check_not_found` - Email not in system
- `email_check_no_tenant` - User exists but no tenant associated
- `login_success` - Successful login (tenant user)
- `login_failed` - Failed login attempt
- `master_admin_login_success` - Master admin successful login
- `master_admin_login_failed` - Master admin failed login

### Security Events
- `email_check_error` - Error during email check
- `login_error` - Error during login process

## 🔍 Risk Scoring System

### Base Risk Scores
- Normal pattern: **10**
- Unusual pattern (new IP/device): **40**

### Progressive Risk Scoring
- Failed login attempt: **+10 per attempt**
- Master admin failure: **+30**
- Maximum: **100**

### Unusual Pattern Detection
- Checks last 20 successful logins
- Compares IP address (new IP = unusual)
- Compares User-Agent (new browser = unusual)

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
-- Time-based queries (descending for recent events)
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_Timestamp (Timestamp DESC)

-- User activity tracking
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_Email
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_Email_Timestamp

-- IP-based analysis
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_IpAddress
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_IpAddress_Timestamp

-- Event type filtering
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_Event
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_Event_Timestamp

-- High-risk event detection (filtered index)
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_RiskScore WHERE RiskScore > 50

-- Tenant analysis
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_TenantCode

-- User-specific tracking
IX_SecurityAuditLogs_UserId
```

## 📋 Next Steps - Manual Actions Required

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
cd src/Infrastructure/Stocker.Persistence
dotnet ef database update --context MasterDbContext
```

### 2. Verify Migration Success
```sql
-- Check if table was created
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'master' AND TABLE_NAME = 'SecurityAuditLogs';

-- Check indexes
SELECT * FROM sys.indexes
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('master.SecurityAuditLogs');
```

### 3. Test Audit Logging

#### Test Login Flow
```bash
# 1. Attempt login with valid credentials
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "validpassword"
}

# 2. Check SecurityAuditLogs table
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;

# Expected: login_success event with IP, UserAgent, and risk score
```

#### Test Failed Login Detection
```bash
# 1. Multiple failed login attempts
POST /api/auth/login (with wrong password) x3

# 2. Query risk scores
SELECT Event, Email, RiskScore, Timestamp
FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
WHERE Email = 'test@example.com'
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;

# Expected: Progressive risk scores (10, 20, 30, 40...)
```

#### Test Unusual Pattern Detection
```bash
# 1. Login from different IP/browser
# 2. Check if marked as unusual
SELECT Event, Email, IpAddress, UserAgent, RiskScore
FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
WHERE Email = 'test@example.com' AND Event LIKE '%login%'
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;

# Expected: Higher base risk score (40 instead of 10)
```

### 4. Production Deployment

#### Database Migration
```bash
# Production environment
cd src/Infrastructure/Stocker.Persistence
dotnet ef migrations script --context MasterDbContext --output migration.sql

# Review migration.sql before applying
# Apply using SSMS or Azure Data Studio
```

#### Monitor Performance
```sql
-- Check index usage after 1 week
SELECT
    i.name AS IndexName,
    s.user_seeks,
    s.user_scans,
    s.user_lookups,
    s.user_updates
FROM sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats s
JOIN sys.indexes i ON s.object_id = i.object_id AND s.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE s.database_id = DB_ID() AND OBJECT_NAME(s.object_id) = 'SecurityAuditLogs';
```

### 5. Setup Data Retention (Optional)

#### SQL Server Agent Job for Cleanup
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [master].[CleanupSecurityAuditLogs]
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
    WHERE CreatedAt < DATEADD(DAY, -RetentionDays, GETUTCDATE());
END;
GO

-- Schedule daily cleanup (SQL Server Agent)
-- Run time: 2:00 AM daily
```

## 🔐 GDPR Compliance

### Data Categories
- `authentication` - Login and authentication events (365 days default retention)
- Custom categories can be added as needed

### Data Retention
- Default: 365 days
- Configurable per event type
- Automatic cleanup with SQL Agent job

### User Rights
- Right to access: Query by Email or UserId
- Right to deletion: DELETE WHERE Email = 'user@example.com'
- Right to export: JSON metadata field contains all event details

## 📊 Analytics Queries

### Daily Login Activity
```sql
SELECT
    CAST(Timestamp AS DATE) AS Date,
    COUNT(*) AS TotalLogins,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Event = 'login_success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Successful,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Event = 'login_failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Failed
FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
WHERE Event LIKE '%login%'
GROUP BY CAST(Timestamp AS DATE)
ORDER BY Date DESC;
```

### High-Risk Events
```sql
SELECT TOP 100
    Timestamp,
    Event,
    Email,
    IpAddress,
    RiskScore,
    Metadata
FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
WHERE RiskScore > 50
ORDER BY Timestamp DESC;
```

### Failed Login Attempts by User
```sql
SELECT
    Email,
    COUNT(*) AS FailedAttempts,
    MAX(Timestamp) AS LastAttempt,
    MAX(RiskScore) AS MaxRiskScore
FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
WHERE Event = 'login_failed'
GROUP BY Email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY FailedAttempts DESC;
```

### Unusual Login Patterns
```sql
SELECT
    Email,
    IpAddress,
    UserAgent,
    COUNT(*) AS Count,
    MAX(Timestamp) AS LastSeen
FROM master.SecurityAuditLogs
WHERE RiskScore >= 40 AND Event LIKE '%login%'
GROUP BY Email, IpAddress, UserAgent
ORDER BY Count DESC;
```

## 🎯 Summary

The audit logging system is **fully implemented** and ready for production. All code is in place, the migration is created, and comprehensive audit tracking is integrated into:

- ✅ Email check flow (PublicController)
- ✅ Regular user login (AuthController)
- ✅ Master admin login (MasterAuthController)
- ✅ Secure cookie-based login (SecureAuthController)

**Next step**: Apply the database migration and test the system.

```bash
# Apply migration
cd src/Infrastructure/Stocker.Persistence
dotnet ef database update --context MasterDbContext

# Verify
# Check SecurityAuditLogs table in MSSQL
# Test login flows
# Monitor audit logs
```
