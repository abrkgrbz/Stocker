## Overview
The test infrastructure has been successfully set up for the Stocker application with both unit and integration test projects.

## Test Projects Created

### 1. Stocker.UnitTests
- **Location**: `/tests/Stocker.UnitTests/`
- **Framework**: xUnit 2.8.0
- **Coverage Tool**: Coverlet 6.0.0
- **Status**: ✅ Building and Running Successfully
- **Tests**: 3 basic tests (as starting point)

### 2. Frontend Tests (Existing)
- **stocker-admin**: Has vitest and playwright configured for unit and e2e tests
- **stocker-web**: Has vitest and playwright configured for unit and e2e tests

## Test Execution Results

### Unit Tests
```
✅ Total Tests: 3
✅ Passed: 3
❌ Failed: 0
⏭️ Skipped: 0
⏱️ Duration: ~10ms
```

## Coverage Setup
- ✅ Coverlet.msbuild installed for code coverage
- ✅ Coverlet.collector installed for XPlat coverage
- ✅ ReportGenerator installed for HTML reports
- ✅ Coverage reports generating successfully

### Coverage Report Location
- XML: `/tests/Stocker.UnitTests/TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml`
- HTML: `/coverage/report/index.html`

## Scripts Available

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
dotnet test tests/Stocker.UnitTests/Stocker.UnitTests.csproj

# Run with coverage
dotnet test tests/Stocker.UnitTests/Stocker.UnitTests.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Generate HTML report
reportgenerator -reports:"tests/Stocker.UnitTests/TestResults/*/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coverage/report" -reporttypes:Html
```

### Frontend Tests (stocker-admin)
```bash
npm test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage
npm run test:e2e   # Run E2E tests with Playwright
```

### Frontend Tests (stocker-web)
```bash
npm test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage
npm run test:e2e   # Run E2E tests with Playwright
```

## Next Steps for Real Coverage Improvement

To achieve meaningful coverage (target: 30-70%), the following test categories should be implemented:

### 1. Domain Layer Tests
- [ ] Entity validation tests
- [ ] Value object tests
- [ ] Business rule tests
- [ ] Domain event tests

### 2. Application Layer Tests
- [ ] Command handler tests
- [ ] Query handler tests
- [ ] Validator tests
- [ ] Service tests

### 3. Infrastructure Layer Tests
- [ ] Repository tests with in-memory database
- [ ] Token generation service tests
- [ ] Authentication service tests
- [ ] Caching service tests

### 4. API Layer Tests
- [ ] Controller integration tests
- [ ] Middleware tests
- [ ] Authorization tests
- [ ] API response tests

### 5. Frontend Tests
- [ ] Component unit tests
- [ ] Store tests (Zustand)
- [ ] Service tests
- [ ] E2E user journey tests

## Infrastructure Ready
✅ Test projects configured and working
✅ Coverage tools installed and configured
✅ Build pipeline successful
✅ Basic tests running as proof of concept

## Notes
- The test infrastructure is now ready for systematic test implementation
- Current coverage is low because only basic proof-of-concept tests exist
- Real domain/application tests need to be written based on actual business logic
- Both backend (.NET) and frontend (React) test infrastructures are properly configured
